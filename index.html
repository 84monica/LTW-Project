				<ol>
				  <li>The game starts with one player choosing a specific hole and then picking up all the seeds in it. If you’re it, you need to deposit one seed in each hole, following a counterclockwise direction, until all the seeds run out.</li>
				  <li>There are several ways to determine who should make the first move. Via the classic rock, paper, scissors or other games.</li>
				  <li>Every time you run into your own Mancala, deposit one seed. If it’s the opponent’s store, skip it.</li>
				  <li>If the last seed is dropped in your own store, you get a free turn. You pick all the seeds in your store and run the play again.</li>
				  <li>If the last seed is dropped into an empty hole on your side, you get that seed and all those in the hole directly opposite.</li>
				  <li>All the seeds you capture must be placed in your store.</li>
				  <li>You lose a turn when you run out of stones in your hand.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Winning the game</p>
				<p class="Instructions">
					When all six spaces on one side of the Mancala board are empty, the game ends. If you still have seeds on your side of the board at this point, you capture all of them.
					<br>
					The winner is declared based on the number of seeds. The one with the most seeds in each store wins.
					<br>
					The winner is basically determined after all the seeds captured are counted.
					<br>
					If you want to win, there are certain strategies you can employ.
					<br>
					Since you get another turn if the last seed is dropped in your own mancala, you need to choose wisely which hole to start with.
					<br>
					If you get the first turn, choose a hole that is 5 holes away from your mancala. This way, the last stone will be dropped in your own store. This gives you another turn.
					<br>
					If you used up your second turn and your opponent played the whole that is one or two holes away from their mancala, play the sixth hole from your store. This will guarantee you another free turn.
					<br>
					Another strategy will be to play the hole where the last seed in your hand will land in an empty store on your side. If the hole opposite it has seeds, you capture all of them.
					<br>
					Remember, the goal of the game is to capture more seeds than your opponent.
